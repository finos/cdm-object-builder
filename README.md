# CDM Object Builder

This project is a utility tool for dynamically generating Common Domain Model<sup>TM</sup> (CDM)  objects using a visual UI builder which can then be reviewed. 

The tool provides functionality for navigating the CDM<sup>TM</sup> starting at a root type and traversing its nodes (attributes) to build up an object visually in the user interface.

The version of the CDM<sup>TM</sup> used is fixed at build time in the model file ./ui/src/app/modules/builder/services/builder-api.model.ts. 

The Common Domain Model<sup>TM</sup> is a registered trademark of FINOS. For more information please visit https://cdm.finos.org/

## Installation

To start the web-based user interface locally, navigate to the ./ui folder and run 
```sh
npm ci
npm start 
```

## Usage example

A use case for the Object Builder is the selection of Eligible Collateral Schedules.


## Development setup

To update the version of the model used by this tool  execute the Java utility 
```sh
./server/src/main/java/com/regnosys/TypescriptObjectBuilderModelGenerator.java
```
 and follow the instructions outlined in the main() method.
